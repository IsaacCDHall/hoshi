## Description

_This application takes a users age in Earth Years and calculates their age relative to other planets in our solar system_

### Specs

1. Takes in a users birthday and life expectancy 

2. Use the Date Object to calculate their current age, based on the difference between the current time and when they were born.

3. Converts Earth years to years on other planets.
* Mercury (.24 Earth years)
* Venus (.62 Earth years)
* Mars (1.88 Earth years)
* Jupiter (11.86 Earth years)

5. Determine how many years the user has left to live on each planet.
